        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey there! I'm Yakshi Garg, a passionate web developer who thrives on crafting unique and functional digital experiences. I fell in love with web development as it beautifully combines my love for design and problem-solving.

            With a keen eye for detail and a dedication to creating user-centric designs, I specialize in front-end development, ensuring that every line of code I write enhances the user's interaction with a website. I'm constantly exploring new technologies and trends to stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving web landscape.
            
            When I'm not immersed in code, you might find me sketching interface designs or exploring the latest in UX/UI trends. I strongly believe that great design goes beyond aesthetics; it's about enhancing the way users interact with the digital world.
            
            I've had the pleasure of working on various projects, from e-commerce sites to interactive web applications. My goal is to not just build websites but to craft intuitive, engaging, and accessible digital experiences that leave a lasting impact.</p>
